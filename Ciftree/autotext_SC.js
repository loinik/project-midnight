    EG_AboutSoren07_SFX: "<c0><c1>Mm. Being his friend has a price here. You are either \"outside\" or \"inside\" in Skipbrot. You cannot stand in the doorway. You will be driven out. We are not like Reykjavik - like a big city.",

    EG_ShipIsFamily08_N_SFX: "<c0>What happens if you do find it?<c1>",

    EG_MagnusInfo07_SFX: "<c0><c1>Hmmph.",
    EG_MagnusInfo08_SFX: "<c0><c1>He is... quiet. Thoughtful. Keenly obsessive. First over his dog, then over his writing, then over me, then over the ship. ",
    EG_MagnusInfo09_N_SFX: "<c0>Why would someone like him be hunting for gold in the first place?<c1>",
    EG_MagnusInfo10_SFX: "<c0><c1>He has certain intentions with the treasure.",
    EG_MagnusInfo11_N_SFX: "<c0>Which were?<c1>",
    EG_MagnusInfo12_SFX: "<c0><c1>A boat of his own. He desperately wants to leave town -- leave Iceland.",
    EG_MagnusInfo13_N_SFX: "<c0>I thought he was a captain already.<c1>",
    EG_MagnusInfo14_SFX: "<c0><c1>Oh, he is. But for wealthy people - private clients. Never his own boat, never his own destination.",
    EG_MagnusInfo15_SFX: "<c0><c1>He dreams of living like the old captains, sailing wherever the wind takes him. ",
    EG_MagnusInfo16_N_SFX: "<c0>I see. So the treasure would allow him to fulfill that dream. <c1>",
    EG_MagnusInfo17_SFX: "<c0><c1>Here. Have this.",
    EG_MagnusInfoB01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Magnus left it at my place. After we broke up, he called me looking for it -- but I hid it.",
    EG_MagnusInfoB03_SFX: "<c0><c1>I don't know why I kept it for myself. Maybe I wanted to see whatever it was he saw in this hunk of driftwood.",
    EG_MagnusInfoB02_SFX: "<c0><c1>It looks like it might be the key to open some kind of box. But I've never seen any box like that before. ",
    EG_MagnusInfoC01_N_SFX: "<c0>Thanks, Elisabet. I'm going to get to the bottom of this mess. <c1>",
    EG_TownDebt01_N_SFX: "<c0>I heard about the town's debt issues. <c1>",
    EG_TownDebt02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I don't know what you're talking about.",
    EG_TownDebt03_N_SFX: "<c0>I found some information in the culture center. <c1>",
    EG_TownDebt04_N_SFX: "<c0>You exhausted the town bank account on the last few festivals, didn't you?<c1>",
    EG_TownDebtB01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Who are you, to come in and intimidate me out of nowhere? Get out of my sight. Get off the ship!",
    EG_TownDebtC01_SFX: "<c0><c1>So you... want to gloat? To chastise me? Yes, it's true. Yes, that's my fault.",
    EG_TownDebtC02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I won't sit here and defend myself. What I did was wrong. But I told Soren I was going to fix it, and I will.",
    EG_HeardStory01_N_SFX: "<c0>I heard the story about your family.<c1>",
    EG_HeardStory02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I grew up with so much anger. I couldn't believe people would do that to one another. ",
    EG_HeardStory03_N_SFX: "<c0>People do strange things when money's on the line. I'd think they could bury the hatchet and move on. I guess not.<c1>",
    EG_HeardStory04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Nothing is ever buried here. Just sleeping. ",
    EG_HeardStory05_SFX: "<c0><c1>And sometimes, it awakens in unexpected ways.",
    EG_MagnusSplit01_N_SFX: "<c0>I heard your messages on Magnus's machine. You mentioned \"ruining\" him.<c1>",

    EG_MagnusSplit03_N_SFX: "<c0>I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's part of the investigation.<c1>",
    EG_MagnusSplit04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Understood. Just know that I have moved past that now.",
    EG_MagnusSplit05_SFX: "<c0><c1>A large part of me still cares about him. But I am healing and rebuilding -- stronger than before, I think.",
    EG_Door01_N_SFX: "<c0>So what's behind the mystery door?<c1>",
    EG_Door02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Just an old broom closet.",
    EG_Door03_N_SFX: "<c0>Can I see?<c1>",
    EG_Door04_SFX: "<c0><c1>No. ",
    EG_Door05_N_SFX: "<c0>Not even a hint?<c1>",
    EG_Door06_SFX: "<c0><c1>Go away.",
    EG_AfterTumi01_N_SFX: "<c0>So much for finding Magnus, I guess. <c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi02_SFX: "<c0><c1>You thought I was hiding Magnus?",
    EG_AfterTumi03_N_SFX: "<c0>You have to admit, it was really suspicious. Sorry I pinned you wrong, though. <c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi04_SFX: "<c0><c1>I... guess it was a little strange.",
    EG_AfterTumi05_N_SFX: "<c0>So... I have to ask the obvious: why are you keeping a dog in a closet?<c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi06_SFX: "<c0><c1>Tumi wouldn't do well in a shelter.",
    EG_AfterTumi07_N_SFX: "<c0>He seems to really like you. <c1>",

    EG_AfterTumi09_N_SFX: "<c0>When did you manage to get Tumi?<c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi10_SFX: "<c0><c1>Just before Magnus left to take the ship in to harbor.",

    EG_AfterTumi12_N_SFX: "<c0>Hang on. So you knew Magnus was going to go missing?<c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi13_SFX: "<c0><c1>No. But I knew he'd notice if Tumi did.",
    EG_AfterTumi14_SFX: "<c0><c1>And then maybe he'd have to come looking for me for once.",
    EG_AfterTumi15_N_SFX: "<c0>In the meantime, Tumi's probably happiest with someone he knows nearby.<c1>",
    EG_AfterTumi16_N_SFX: "<c0>Elisabet... pet-napping may not be a healthy way to handle this. <c1>",
    EG_AfterTumiB01_SFX: "<c0><c1>I hope so, too. I shouldn't have taken Tumi - that was wrong. But now that he's here, I'm going to take good care of him. ",

    EG_AfterTumiC02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I feel like it's smarter to keep Tumi here. If someone did abduct Magnus, how long would Tumi spend in a cage at the boarder's?",
    EG_AfterTumiD01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Listen, Nancy... ",
    EG_AfterTumiD02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Just a little while ago, I realized something. When you told me my family song sounded like a love song.",
    EG_AfterTumiD03_SFX: "<c0><c1>That's because it is a love song. It's a love song for my family's heritage: the treasure. ",
    EG_AfterTumiD04_N_SFX: "<c0>So... the purpose of the song was to make sure only Captain Lawrence's descendant could find that treasure.<c1>",
    EG_AfterTumiD05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Here.",
    EG_SongLyrics01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Take the lyrics to the song. I've never shown these to anyone. Maybe they've been the key all along.",

    EG_SongLyrics03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Bring Magnus home.",
    EG_AfterSled01_N_SFX: "<c0>So if you're not the one responsible for all this, why were you pushing that sled?<c1>",
    EG_AfterSled02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Tumi's toys. I... didn't want to leave him alone in a closet without his things.",

    DS_Intro02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I'm Dagny. I'm part of the ship restoration team -    the one who called you in. You can call me \"boss-lady\" if you want. Or \"my queen.\" Or \"Dagny.\" Whatevs.",
    DS_FirstMeet01_N_SFX: "<c0>Let's go with \"Dagny\" for now and work our way up to the big stuff. Can I help?<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yes. Find my missing, skeeving, backstabbing business partner Magnus.",
    DS_FirstMeet03_N_SFX: "<c0>I'm sensing you're a little stressed out about this. <c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Ugh. I'm so mad I've been an inch away from setting this town on fire. ",
    DS_FirstMeet05_N_SFX: "<c0>On fire? Are you okay?<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet06_SFX: "<c0><c1>What?",
    DS_FirstMeet07_N_SFX: "<c0>Just - the fire comment, I thought-<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet08_SFX: "<c0><c1>Metaphors, Nancy. Keep up with me here. ",
    DS_FirstMeet09_SFX: "<c0><c1>So, listen. Right now, I'm focused on this town: Skipbrot.",
    DS_FirstMeet10_SFX: "<c0><c1>There's this ship in town that was being rebuilt. Real old. 18th century.",
    DS_FirstMeet11_SFX: "<c0><c1>I offered to sponsor the rebuilding project to get the ship floating again. Mostly because I'm super nice and cool like that. ",
    DS_FirstMeet12_SFX: "<c0><c1>But also because there's a rumor about a treasure on board worth millions.",
    DS_FirstMeet13_SFX: "<c0><c1>Magnus, the man in charge of the project - and my business partner - promised we'd find it and split the earnings.",
    DS_FirstMeet14_N_SFX: "<c0>But he's gone missing now?<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet15_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yep. And left me looking like a fool. ",
    DS_FirstMeet16_N_SFX: "<c0>Was there any proof that he disappeared intentionally?<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet21_N_SFX: "<c0>When did he vanish?<c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet17_SFX: "<c0><c1>He disappeared sometime before our ship crashed into the harbor. They say he must've fallen in the water, but the guy sails for a living! You know what sailors don't do? Drown.",
    DS_FirstMeet18_N_SFX: "<c0>I get it. You think he ran off with the gold, then. <c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet22_N_SFX: "<c0>That doesn't prove he disappeared on his own. <c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet19_SFX: "<c0><c1>After enough time in the biz, a girl knows when she's being backstabbed.",
    DS_FirstMeet20_SFX: "<c0><c1>I need you to track down Magnus and make him play fair. ",
    DS_FirstMeet23_N_SFX: "<c0>And if I find the treasure, I'll find Magnus. <c1>",
    DS_FirstMeet24_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yes. The key to finding the treasure is learning about that ship. ",
    DS_FirstMeet25_N_SFX: "<c0>So everything's interconnected. Sounds like I've got my work cut out for me. <c1>",
    DS_MagnusVanish01_N_SFX: "<c0>What do people in town think about Magnus's disappearance?<c1>",
    DS_MagnusVanish02_SFX: "<c0><c1>They're all like, \"ooh, the ocean is super dangerous in the winter!\" and \"ooh, hypothermia!\" and bla bla bla. You know, Icelander stuff.",
    DS_MagnusVanish03_N_SFX: "<c0>But without a body... you're still convinced he faked his death. <c1>",
    DS_MagnusVanish04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yep. Which apparently doesn't take a lot of work in Iceland. ",
    DS_LookAtShip01_N_SFX: "<c0>Can I take a look at the ship?<c1>",
    DS_LookAtShip02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Technically, yes.",
    DS_LookAtShip03_N_SFX: "<c0>Awesome! How do I get on board?<c1>",
    DS_LookAtShip04_SFX: "<c0><c1>By not being me, apparently.",
    DS_LookAtShip05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Elisabet controls the ship, and she hates my guts. She removed the gangway. To my ship. That I paid for.",
    DS_LookAtShip06_N_SFX: "<c0>Did she give you a reason?<c1>",
    DS_LookAtShip07_SFX: "<c0><c1>Oh, something about her family line and ancient blood feuds and murders and... y'know. Normal boring stuff. Talk to Soren, the festival organizer. He'll make sure she lets you on.",
    DS_FixHeater01_SFX: "<c0><c1>I didn't think it was possible to be this cold. ",
    DS_FixHeater02_N_SFX: "<c0>Can't you go inside?<c1>",
    DS_FixHeater03_SFX: "<c0><c1>I keep asking people to fix this broken heater so I can watch over my ship. You know what Gunnar told me? \"Freeze for all I care.\" He is the worst human being.",
    DS_FixHeater04_N_SFX: "<c0>Maybe I can help you out with that heater, then.<c1>",
    DS_FixHeater05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Do you know how to do... machine things?",
    DS_FixHeater06_N_SFX: "<c0>I've picked up a few things. <c1>",
    DS_FixHeater07_SFX: "<c0><c1>I don't care what they say - you're okay, Nancy Drew. ",
    DS_MagnusMeet01_N_SFX: "<c0>How'd you meet Magnus?<c1>",
    DS_MagnusMeet02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I heard about the rumor of the treasure through my connections. Then I approached him. He's a hard guy to pin down, that Magnus.",
    DS_MagnusMeet03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Turns out, he's been looking for the treasure for years. I just happened to come in at an opportune moment.",
    DS_MagnusMeet04_N_SFX: "<c0>What would Magnus do with the treasure?<c1>",
    DS_MagnusMeet05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Desperately wants to buy his own ship. He's a ship guy. Ship guys are like that.",
    DS_MagnusMeet06_N_SFX: "<c0>So the ship he helped rebuild isn't his?<c1>",
    DS_MagnusMeet07_SFX: "<c0><c1>We funded it, but it's town property.",
    DS_TreasureOrigin01_N_SFX: "<c0>So - say there is a treasure - what was it doing on the ship in the first place?<c1>",
    DS_TreasureOrigin02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Who knows? Who cares? Money's money. ",
    DS_TreasureOrigin03_N_SFX: "<c0>It just seems fishy, is all.<c1>",
    DS_TreasureOrigin04_SFX: "<c0><c1>It's Iceland. The economy runs on fish.",
    DS_Freezing01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sorry, can't talk, need heat. Teeth freezing into tiny icicles.",
    DS_Freezing02_N_SFX: "<c0>The pub's around the corner. You could always go inside.<c1>",
    DS_Freezing03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Or you could fix the heater.",
    DS_Freezing04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Gee, I wonder which of us will cave first.",
    DS_HeatFixed01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Whew. Toasty. Feels just like home. By the by, have you been up to Magnus's cabin yet?",
    DS_HeatFixed02_N_SFX: "<c0>He has a cabin? Up in the hills?<c1>",
    DS_HeatFixed03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Elisabet keeps a key in her bag - talk about refusing to let go - but there's no way she'd ever give it to you. ",
    DS_HeatFixed05_N_SFX: "<c0>So I'll need to find a way to get her off that deck. <c1>",
    DS_HeatFixed04_SFX: "<c0><c1>If I were you, I'd get a little sneaky about it. ",
    DS_FestivalAlibi01_N_SFX: "<c0>I need to know who was present at the time of the festival.<c1>",
    DS_FestivalAlibi02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I was there.",
    DS_FestivalAlibi03_N_SFX: "<c0>Who else did you see?<c1>",
    DS_FestivalAlibi04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Only Gunnar. Elisabet and Soren were thoroughly MIA.",
    DS_FestivalAlibi05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Although half of Iceland is probably related to itself, so people kinda look alike. Coulda missed something.",
    DS_TimeSpent01_N_SFX: "<c0>So how long were you working on the ship project?<c1>",
    DS_TimeSpent02_SFX: "<c0><c1>About two years. On and off a bit. Magnus supervised the rebuild, I provided the cash.",
    DS_TimeSpent03_N_SFX: "<c0>That's a long time to hang around in Iceland. Have you been in Skipbrot all that time?<c1>",
    DS_TimeSpent04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Hah, no. I think the locals would've offed me by now if that were the case. I don't like to stay in one place for too long. ",
    DS_TimeSpent05_N_SFX: "<c0>Why's that?<c1>",
    DS_TimeSpent06_SFX: "<c0><c1>If you stay in one place, people start to need you and feel things about you and all that icky weird stuff. ",
    DS_TimeSpent07_SFX: "<c0><c1>I'm not really the \"having friends\" type.",
    DS_TimeSpent08_N_SFX: "<c0>I'd like to think you and I are on friendly terms.<c1>",
    DS_TimeSpent09_SFX: "<c0><c1>What is this? Are we gonna hold hands and sing campfire songs now? Pff. Get lost, Drew. Find my gold.",
    DS_Footlocker01_N_SFX: "<c0>I found a strange chest in Magnus's cabin. Can you tell me anything about it?<c1>",
    DS_Footlocker02_SFX: "<c0><c1>What, the weird sock thing?",
    DS_Footlocker03_N_SFX: "<c0>Sock... thing? <c1>",
    DS_Footlocker04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yeah, I saw him open it once. It's his personal footlocker. Something about it is tied to the socks in his room. ",
    DS_Footlocker05_SFX: "<c0><c1>He was always mega paranoid, though. Never let me get a good look. ",
    DS_Messages01_N_SFX: "<c0>I found some pretty hostile messages between you and Magnus.<c1>",
    DS_Messages02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sometimes a girl's gotta get angry to get what she wants. Scare people a little. ",
    DS_Messages05_N_SFX: "<c0>I think you're lying.<c1>",
    DS_Messages03_N_SFX: "<c0>It sounded more like you were threatening him. <c1>",
    DS_Messages04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Okay - then show me exactly where any of those threats came true. You can't, because they were empty. Just scare tactics, Nancy.",
    DS_Elisabet01_N_SFX: "<c0>Elisabet seems like she's withholding information. <c1>",
    DS_Elisabet02_SFX: "<c0><c1>She still seems pretty intense about Magnus, as far as I can tell. And she thinks the treasure \"belongs to her.\" ",
    DS_Elisabet03_SFX: "<c0><c1>I've seen some exes do some preeeeetty wild things when they're going through the stages of grief.",
    DS_Elisabet04_SFX: "<c0><c1>That's why when I end a relationship, I just move to a different continent and change my phone number. So much easier than doing the whole break-up thing.",
    DS_Elisabet05_N_SFX: "<c0>That must be exhausting. <c1>",
    DS_Elisabet06_SFX: "<c0><c1>Ehh... Let's just say I don't really \"do\" mailing addresses anymore.",
    DS_Gunnar01_N_SFX: "<c0>What do you think of Gunnar?<c1>",
    DS_Gunnar02_SFX: "<c0><c1>In terms of the treasure? He tried to sabotage the festival last year, and the year before that. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a stunt of his.",
    DS_FessUp01_N_SFX: "<c0>So you faked that you'd gone missing, huh?<c1>",
    DS_FessUp02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yeah, yeah, don't look at me with those kicked-puppy eyes. I needed some time to crack the case without anyone catching on to me.",
    DS_FessUp03_N_SFX: "<c0>You must have a compelling lead on the treasure. Otherwise, knowing you, you'd never have left the heater. <c1>",
    DS_FessUp13_N_SFX: "<c0>Tell me everything you know, or I'm going straight to the police. <c1>",
    DS_FessUp04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Detectives. OK, fine. The ship itself is a map to the treasure.",
    DS_FessUp05_N_SFX: "<c0>I suspected that.<c1>",
    DS_FessUp06_SFX: "<c0><c1>The problem is, the original ship was torn apart. Many of the pieces of the original have been built into the town.",
    DS_FessUp07_SFX: "<c0><c1>I've been putting them together. But something's still missing.",
    DS_FessUp08_SFX: "<c0><c1>I need some sort of key. Something to help me decode the map.",
    DS_FessUp09_N_SFX: "<c0>So... let me guess. You know where to find that key.<c1>",
    DS_FessUp10_SFX: "<c0><c1>Not even. But you know what? I think you do.",
    DS_FessUp11_N_SFX: "<c0>Maybe I do.<c1>",
    DS_FessUp12_N_SFX: "<c0>Sorry, I don't.<c1>",
    DS_FessUpB01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Hmm. A girl with \"principles.\" That's cute.",
    DS_FessUpC01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Playin' it cool, huh? Just a casual reminder that I get a finder's fee for nabbing this treasure, Drew. I might be willing to part with a piece of it for the right gal.",
    DS_FessUpC02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I like you. I think we could be business partners if this thing rolls out right.",
    DS_FessUpD21_N_SFX: "<c0>I'm starting to think Magnus didn't disappear on his own. All evidence points to you right now, Dagny.<c1>",
    DS_FessUpD22_N_SFX: "<c0>I don't want to believe you'd do something to Magnus, but you're not giving me a lot of options, here. <c1>",
    DS_TakeToken01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Look. I'm being honest. Take this as collateral. It clearly fits somewhere. Just... not sure where. ",
    DS_TakeToken02_SFX: "<c0><c1>I might be greedy, but I'm not a greedy kidnapper.    I want Magnus back safe. Or at least... safe... ish.",
    DS_TakeToken03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Maybe that'll help you. If you decide to stop hating money, I'll be waiting. Toodles!",
    DS_TreasureGive01_N_SFX: "<c0>I've been thinking about the treasure... <c1>",
    DS_TreasureGive02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Oh, yeah?",
    DS_TreasureGive03_N_SFX: "<c0>Elisabet tells me she doesn't want anyone to have ownership of it.<c1>",
    DS_TreasureGive04_SFX: "<c0><c1>Hippies. ",
    DS_TreasureGive05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sometimes I just want to give Elisabet a nice, big Silva family hug. And keep squeezing. ...And squeezing.",
    DS_TreasureGive06_N_SFX: "<c0>I see her point, though. This was a terrible tragedy. Is it really okay for us to profit off that?<c1>",
    DS_TreasureGive07_SFX: "<c0><c1>The dead are dead, Nancy. We either bury them with all their stuff and lose it forever, or we steal the stuff and do something that actually has an impact on the world. Or at least, my checking account.",
    DS_TreasureGive08_SFX: "<c0><c1>Who do you think the treasure belongs to, Nancy?",
    DS_TreasureGive09_N_SFX: "<c0>Elisabet's family are the rightful owners. <c1>",
    DS_TreasureGive14_N_SFX: "<c0>Give it to me!<c1>",
    DS_TreasureGive10_N_SFX: "<c0>Magnus. He's been searching his whole life. <c1>",
    DS_TreasureGIve11_N_SFX: "<c0>It's only fair to give it to Soren.<c1>",
    DS_TreasureGIve12_N_SFX: "<c0>You've invested a lot in this restoration. I think you should have it.<c1>",
    DS_TreasureGIve13_N_SFX: "<c0>I think it belongs to Gunnar. <c1>",
    DS_TreasureGiveB01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sure, give it to the hippie so she can sit on it and fail to re-invest a single penny. ",
    DS_TreasureGiveB02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Over my dead body.",
    DS_TreasureGiveC01_SFX: "<c0><c1>After he stabbed me in the back to go look for it? Some friend you are. I mean... not that we were friends in the first place.",
    DS_TreasureGiveD01_SFX: "<c0><c1>What? That nerd? So he can buy himself a new Viking fork collection or something?",
    DS_TreasureGiveD02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Honestly, Drew. The things that come out of your mouth.",
    DS_TreasureGiveE01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Ooh, I like you. Keep telling me nice things. Tell me my coat looks fab.",
    DS_TreasureGiveF01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Give it to the creepy hobo as an appeasement strategy? I guess you would do that.",
    DS_TreasureGiveG01_SFX: "<c0><c1>I think you've had a little too much caffeine today. You're starting with the crazy talk. ",
    DS_RadioKey01_N_SFX: "<c0>I found a radio on board, but I need a key to turn it on. Can I borrow yours?<c1>",
    DS_RadioKey02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Here you go. ",
    DS_RadioKey03_N_SFX: "<c0>Hey, that was easy! Now... how do I operate the thing?<c1>",
    DS_RadioKey04_SFX: "<c0><c1>I dunno. I don't have radio experience. I have business experience. ",
    DS_RadioKey05_N_SFX: "<c0>Figures. Well, thanks anyway.<c1>",
    GT_Greet01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Ja? ",
    GT_Greet02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Good day.",
    GT_Greet03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Speak up, now.",

    GT_Magnus01_N_SFX: "<c0>Did you know Magnus?<c1>",
    GT_Magnus02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sure did. Never liked 'im.",
    GT_Magnus03_N_SFX: "<c0>Did something happen between you two?<c1>",
    GT_Magnus04_N_SFX: "<c0>Any reason you didn't like him?<c1>",

    GT_MagnusC01_SFX: "<c0><c1>He was too tall. Too poetic. Too cry-into-your-guitar-and-mourn-for-the-sea. Always quiet. Always thinking. Too soft. Beard too short. Coat too long. Eyelashes too full.",
    GT_MagnusD01_N_SFX: "<c0>So I take it you weren't friends. <c1>",
    GT_MagnusD02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Gunnar doesn't need friends! Already have two: mug and chair.",
    GT_AboutTreasure01_N_SFX: "<c0>Did Magnus ever say anything about the treasure?<c1>",
    GT_AboutTreasure02_SFX: "<c0><c1>He might have.",

    GT_Festival01_N_SFX: "<c0>Did you attend the festival this year?<c1>",
    GT_Festival02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Yes. Embarrassing.",
    GT_Festival03_N_SFX: "<c0>For you?<c1>",
    GT_Festival04_SFX: "<c0><c1>No, everyone else. The scrambling around for hidden treasure. Embarrassing.",
    GT_Festival06_SFX: "<c0><c1>When I was all young, we fought over things like \"longest fish\" and \"shiniest boat!\" Not gold!",
    GT_Festival08_SFX: "<c0><c1>Ever since that Soren took over the festival running, it's been straight to the bottom with it.",
    GT_Sabotage01_N_SFX: "<c0>I heard you've had problems with the festival the last couple of years. Care to talk about that?<c1>",
    GT_Sabotage02_SFX: "<c0><c1>The festival is not what it once was. I'll return things to the old ways, no matter how many buckets of hot tar I have to dump!",
    GT_Sabotage03_SFX: "<c0><c1>Some of the harbor boats still have holes in their bottoms.",
    GT_Sabotage04_N_SFX: "<c0>I see. Did you have a plan like that for this year, too?<c1>",
    GT_Sabotage05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Elisabet said no more trouble or she kicks me out of the Skip.",
    GT_Sabotage06_SFX: "<c0><c1>I only pay with an angry sheep. ",
    GT_Sabotage07_N_SFX: "<c0>What does that mean?<c1>",
    GT_Sabotage08_SFX: "<c0><c1>Means I do it, but I don't like it.",
    GT_Fingers01_N_SFX: "<c0>I was wondering about your fingers. <c1>",
    GT_Fingers02_SFX: "<c0><c1>My \"lucky three?\"",
    GT_Fingers03_N_SFX: "<c0>Is that what you call them?<c1>",
    GT_Fingers05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sure is. It's a long story...",
    GT_Fingers07_SFX: "<c0><c1>Now, there I was, out in the pitch black of night, with no sign of shore and only my fishin' spear. When suddenly, I saw a shadow... ",
    GT_Fingers08_SFX: "<c0><c1>It was a mighty squid, the greatest hunter of them all. Few men have lived to see it and tell the tale. So I pulled out my spear. Just a little too fast, mind you.",
    GT_Fingers09_N_SFX: "<c0>And that's how you lost your fingers?<c1>",
    GT_Fingers10_SFX: "<c0><c1>Of course not! I threw the spear right overboard and I hauled that fellow into my net. Took all my weight just to keep him from wriggling free! ",
    GT_Fingers11_SFX: "<c0><c1>But his strength proved too much for me. He gnashed his giant beak, and well, I was done for. ",
    GT_Fingers12_N_SFX: "<c0>So the squid took your fingers. <c1>",
    GT_Fingers13_SFX: "<c0><c1>No, no, no, no!",
    GT_Fingers14_SFX: "<c0><c1>Right as I thought I was dead, a massive shark leapt out of the waves and ate the squid!",
    GT_Fingers15_SFX: "<c0><c1>It was the sleeper shark, a solid six meters long, with four rows of teeth!",
    GT_Fingers16_SFX: "<c0><c1>He bit my arm and pulled me under as I gasped for my last breath.",
    GT_Fingers17_N_SFX: "<c0>So it was... a shark, then..?<c1>",
    GT_Fingers18_SFX: "<c0><c1>No! I managed to punch him in the nose! You ever fight a shark, you know how to punch him in the nose? He let me go, I swam like a merman and made it back to shore!",
    GT_Fingers19_SFX: "<c0><c1>Three months later, I was in a wood shop accident. Lopped my fingers clean off. ",
    GT_Fingers22_N_SFX: "<c0>Ah... ha. Oh, boy.<c1>",

    PAT_SFIntro03_N_SFX: "<c0>Sure. Educate me!<c1>",
    PAT_FactA01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Okay. Ship Fact: The \"forecastle\" on a ship refers to the upper-forward deck of a sailing ship, but it's pronounced \"forecastle.\"",

    PAT_FactB02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Food for thought: In the days of pirates, some governments decided to get in on the raiding action by authorizing certain ships to act just like pirates. In other words, they were allowed to board and steal from other ships as much as they liked. ",

    PNN_IntroH08_N_SFX: "<c0>Oh, boy. That was just... the worst. <c1>",
    PNN_IntroH09_SFX: "<c0><c1>Hey, you stood me up. Pretty sure I get a free pass on puns for eternity. Also... I've been at this restaurant for a while, and the waiter's glaring at me. I think I should get out of here.",

    PNN_Surprise04_SFX: "<c0><c1>You don't remember? Two years ago.",

    PNN_Bears06_SFX: "<c0><c1>But one of the coolest things you see is the pre-bear wasp behavior. Wasps have to lay their eggs inside moth larva, so they're all fighting like crazy over the best larvae they can find. They're killing each other right and left.",
    PNN_Bears07_SFX: "<c0><c1>And then suddenly a bear comes along and wham! Just takes a chunk out of their hive. And suddenly, the wasps don't care about the larva anymore. They're all about this crazy bear invader. They unite against the bear.",

    PNN_Bears09_SFX: "<c0><c1>You know what I mean?",
    PNN_Bears10_N_SFX: "<c0>I think you just compared me to a bear.<c1>",

    PNN_Bears12_N_SFX: "<c0>Thanks. <c1>",
    PNN_Bears13_SFX: "<c0><c1>What I mean is, in a small town, the hive has a set order. Anything which might disrupt that order is a bigger enemy than any internal arguments. ",
    PNN_Bears14_SFX: "<c0><c1>So, it's not you, and it's not your fault.",
    PNN_Bears15_SFX: "<c0><c1>They're just acting on instinct.",
    PNN_Bears16_N_SFX: "<c0>For some weird reason, that actually makes me feel better. <c1>",

    PNN_BurtRoomie04_N_SFX: "<c0>What's wrong with that?<c1>",
    PNN_BurtRoomie05_SFX: "<c0><c1>No, I mean, fertilized eggs. Like, for chicken breeding. Have you ever seen a dorm room full of chickens?",

    PNN_BurtRoomie07_SFX: "<c0><c1>It's a life experience, let me tell ya. Anyways, the rooster calls at dawn got to be a little much - Burt's a bit noise sensitive, you know - and he decided to move out. ",

    PNN_HelpShipInfo04_N_SFX: "<c0>It does?<c1>",
    PNN_HelpShipInfo05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Sure. I mean, imagine you're a super shady ship captain hiding a secret treasure. You know where the treasure's hidden, but you don't want anyone else to know. ",
    PNN_HelpShipInfo06_SFX: "<c0><c1>So you separate stuff out. Make it hard for anyone else to accumulate pieces. ",
    PNN_HelpShipInfo07_SFX: "<c0><c1>Once someone has a piece, they probably won't let go of it, right? And if they're greedy, which people are, they won't tell anyone else about it, either.",

    PNN_Magnus01_SFX: "<c0><c1>Is he Icelandic?",
    PNN_Magnus02_N_SFX: "<c0>Yes. His name is Magnus, and he's one of the people who's been looking for the treasure. <c1>",

    Silhouettes01_SFX: "<c0><c1>The year was 1783 when Laki fissures opened, and vomited fire and smoke onto the land. <c2>",
    Silhouettes02_SFX: "<c0><c1>Thousands perished immediately into the madness. And the sky grew dark, and even foreign lands were covered.<c2>",
    Silhouettes03_SFX: "<c0><c1>We called those times the \"mist hardships.\" And in that darkness, the people of Skipbrot struggled to survive.<c2>",
    Silhouettes04_SFX: "<c0><c1>One night, a ship came crashing into harbor. It was the Heerlijkheid.<c2>",
    Silhouettes05_SFX: "<c0><c1>Captain Lawrence and his crew were rescued, and taken in.<c2>",
    Silhouettes06_SFX: "<c0><c1>Once ashore, Lawrence explained that he carried with him a mountain of golden treasure. <c2>",
    Silhouettes24_SFX: "<c0><c1>He promised to share it, along with his ship's food supplies, in exchange for shelter until winter's end.<c2>",
    Silhouettes07_SFX: "<c0><c1>That winter was darker than ever. No stars shone, and soon, even the supplies on the Heerlijkheid ran thin. <c2>",
    Silhouettes08_SFX: "<c0><c1>But even in the middle of that hardship, love bloomed. For Lawrence had fallen in love with Alda, the daughter of the town's founding family. <c2>",
    Silhouettes09_SFX: "<c0><c1>Soon, Lawrence and Alda were wed. And soon after that, their marriage bore a baby girl.<c2>",
    Silhouettes10_SFX: "<c0><c1>Eventually, the poisoned water drew away from the shores, and the fish returned to Skipbrot. Thanks to Lawrence, many more people had survived than in neighboring towns.<c2>",
    Silhouettes11_SFX: "<c0><c1>The townspeople wanted to rebuild their home. They needed money - and fast. They needed the treasure Lawrence had promised them.<c2>",
    Silhouettes12_SFX: "<c0><c1>But Lawrence explained that he would need to sail somewhere else in order to retrieve his promised treasure.<c2>",
    Silhouettes13_SFX: "<c0><c1>The townspeople called Lawrence a liar. They accused him of trying to escape with his new wife and child.<c2>",
    Silhouettes14_SFX: "<c0><c1>They grew angrier and angrier. Soon, a fight had broken out.<c2>",
    Silhouettes15_SFX: "<c0><c1>When the dust cleared, the townspeople looked in horror at what they had done. Alda was no longer breathing.<c2>",
    Silhouettes16_SFX: "<c0><c1>The townspeople carried a heavily-injured Lawrence into the inn, intending to banish him once he had recovered from his wounds.<c2>",
    Silhouettes17_SFX: "<c0><c1>But he, too, passed away, leaving only a diary for his young daughter.<c2>",
    Silhouettes18_SFX: "<c0><c1>That daughter eventually grew, married, and bore a daughter of her own - and so on.<c2>",
    Silhouettes19_SFX: "<c0><c1>Today, Elisabet is the only remaining descendant of the original Captain Lawrence...<c2>",
    Silhouettes20_SFX: "<c0><c1>...But the fabled treasure Lawrence spoke of was never found. <c2>",

    Silhouettes22_SFX: "<c0>Elisabet's family has gone through so much. <c1><c2>",

    Magnus_Message02_SFX: "<c0><c1>MAGNUS: Tried to find someone to fix it in time, but no luck. Looks like there won't be sound for the festival after all. <c2>",

    Dagny_Message01b_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: I think I've found something big. I wanna show it to you. I stashed it in my bag for now, but I think this could be part of our big break, you know what I mean?<c2>",
    Dagny_Message02_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Hey, remember the plan we laid out for today?<c2>",
    Dagny_Message02b_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Remember the part where we were all like, \"Hey, we should crash the ship into harbor and then abandon it, leaving Dagny to handle all the PR fallout?\" <c2>",
    Dagny_Message02c_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Yeah, me neither. Thanks a lot, Magnus. Wherever you're hiding out, I hope you're happy with yourself. <c2>",
    Dagny_Message03_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: I'm bringing in a detective to investigate. I don't know where you are or what you're trying to pull, but rest assured, I will find you.<c2>",

    Gracie_Line03_SFX: "<c0><c1>GRACIE: We do have some questions about scope -- we think 240 limericks might be a little much. Is there any way you could cut that down a bit?<c2>",
    Gracie_Line04_SFX: "<c0><c1>GRACIE: Anyway, give me a call back and I'd love to chat further. Bye now!<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO01_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Uhh, does this look functional to you? Get back here!<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO02_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: So, we're gonna do this middle-management style. That is, you do the work, and I \"supervise.\"<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO03_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Each of those circuit pieces will attach anywhere on this board, but there are special numbers you've gotta watch out for.<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO04_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Covered numbers add together to give that piece a total value. <c2>",

    Dagny_HeaterVO09_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Hey, if I did all the hard thinking around here, you'd be out of a job. <c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO10_SFX: "<c0>So, where'd you come from?<c1><c2>",

    Dagny_HeaterVO13_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: South. Ish.<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO14_SFX: "<c0>I'd just like to get to know you a little.<c1><c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO15_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: I went to school, then I had a job, and then I was married, and then I wasn't, and now I have another job involving definitely-legal treasure hunting activities. That's me.<c2>",

    Dagny_HeaterVO17_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Anyone who isn't paying me. If you want to write me a check, I can tell you a sad back-story and we can both pretend it's real.<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO18_SFX: "<c0>Sorry, I left my checkbook at the lodge.<c1><c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO19_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: Maybe next time, then. I mean, are you an open book with every stranger who crosses your path?<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO20_SFX: "<c0>Well... no. I guess I don't like to talk about myself much, either. <c1><c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO21_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: What's your jam? Witness protection program? Arch nemesis?<c2>",
    Dagny_HeaterVO22_SFX: "<c0>None of those. I guess it's that I meet so many interesting people, I just feel... ordinary by comparison.<c1><c2>",

    Dagny_HeaterVO24_SFX: "<c0><c1>DAGNY: People think my job is all glam and adrenaline, but that all got boring years ago. Now it's just nine-to-five headache involving lots of diplomacy and occasional gunfire.<c2>",
